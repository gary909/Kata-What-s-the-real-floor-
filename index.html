    <h1>Kata: What's the real floor?</h1>
    <h2>Open the console...</h2>
    <p>
      Americans are odd people: in their buildings, the first floor is actually
      the <br />
      ground floor and there is no 13th floor (due to superstition).<br />
      <br />
      Write a function that given a floor in the american system returns the
      floor <br />
      in the european system.<br />
      <br />
      With the 1st floor being replaced by the ground floor and the 13th floor
      being <br />
      removed, the numbers move down to take their place. In case of above 13,
      they <br />
      move down by two because there are two omitted numbers below them.<br />
      <br />
      Basements (negatives) stay the same as the universal level.<br />
      <br />
